# adventofcode2020

A short notice that from Day 19 and onward:

I am not happy with how the code looks, it's a bit of a mess. I want to refactor these but right now a lot of time has gone into solving the problems for me so I will have to push this until later. If anyone is browsing this repo, please note that the quality of code decreases at Day 19 by quite some margin.

Hope you are having fun with Advent of Code 2020!
